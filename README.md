My very initial works on creating very simple bots on **web scrapers**

I have been working on learning python for machine learning, deep learning and web scraping and creating bots .

This repo has links to some of my early work on web scraping using **beautifulsoup**, __selenium__ in python and working with various HTML tags to browse, scrape and perform machine learning on extracted data. 

## Examples
