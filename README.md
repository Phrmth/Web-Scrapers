My very initial works on creating very simple bots on html pages

I have been working on learning python for machine learning, deep learning and web scraping and creating bots .

This repo has links to some of my early work on web scraping using beautifulsoup, selenium in python and working with various HTML tags to browse, scrape and perform machine learning on extracted data.
